Week 1 Challenge: Creating Static Website  

1. Created a bucket and added a static web page to the bucket  

2. Created a domain and certificate from the certificate manager  

3. Route 53 already created because the domain was created with aws  

4. Created a record for the certificate in route 53 hosted zone  

5. Created a cloudfront distribution and linked the bucket to it  

6. Restricted the bucket access just to the cloudfront with the OAI key  

7. Added DNS name and certificate to the cloudfront  

8. Made it accessable only on https  

9. Once everything was created we made a record so the domain name redirected to the cloudfront url
